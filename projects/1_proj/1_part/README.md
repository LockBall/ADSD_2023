ring_osc_gen.py : ring oscillator generator is the python file that generates ngspice files

it generates the following:
  a variable number of ring oscillators .cir files: ring_osc_x.cir
  a run ring oscillator file: run_ring_osc_file
  
it requires the following
  nand.cir
  inverter.cir

i took a break from this project and have not re-verified functionality of it

it uses ngspice 37
